This is an extension for [DiabolicUI](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/diabolicui) that adds movement and resizing to the chat frames, something not usually allowed there. This extension requires [DiabolicUI](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/diabolicui) to be present.

The features in this DiabolicUI extension were requested by the YouTube streamer [Mortalhordewarrior](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM1iVH2WQObUFVaUDKNC9BA)!

## Current Features
- Allows unlocking and movement of all chat windows.
- Stores the window positions in the addon, not the game client, meaning your setup will follow DiabolicUI, but not any other UIs you toggle too. Note that using other chat addons or resetting the chat using Blizzard's interface *will* cause positions to be saved to the game client.

## Planned Features
*The following features are not yet available!*
- Font family selection supporting sharedmedia.

## Chat Commands
- **/resetchat** *- Resets the size and position of the primary window.*
- **/resetchat all** *- As above, but also docks any currently floating windows.*
